TextTable
=========

I've written far too many tiny scripts that output stuff in tables to not write something to output stuff in tables in a generic way

Usage:
 Right now the only way to use this is to build the jar and include it somewhere in your classpath.

 E.g:
  - gradle build
  - locate TextTable.jar in the build folder
  - copy TextTable.jar to your groovy-installation's global library-space (or your personal library space)(or add the jar using the -cp command)
